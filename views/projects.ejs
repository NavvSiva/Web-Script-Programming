                <h2>Hardware Encryption</h2>
                <p>In this project, I explored the role of hardware encryption 
                    in securing automotive systems, wireless sensor networks, 
                    instant messaging, and IoT devices. My research highlights
                    the shift from traditional Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs)
                    to firmware-based TPMs, embedded directly within CPUs.
                    This integration enhances system security and efficiency.
                    Key findings from IEEE papers emphasize how hardware encryption 
                    improves energy efficiency, operational speed, and resilience 
                    against cyber threats.</p>

                <h2>CryptoMine Network Configuration</h2>
                <p>Through collaborative work, I helped develop a comprehensive network solution 
                    for CryptoMine, a newly merged cryptocurrency mining company with 
                    branches across North America. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, our team 
                    configured a dedicated WAN using BGP to connect offices in Chicago, 
                    Vancouver, Toronto, and Mexico. The project included setting up VLANs, 
                    EtherChannel, OSPF routing, BGP, inter-VLAN routing, and trunking 
                    across multiple sites. We also designed a secure remote access solution 
                    from Ontario Tech Residence, allowing full management of the network 
                    infrastructure.</p>

                <h2>EV Charging Station Route Optimization</h2>
                <p>In this group project for my Algorithms and Data Structures class, we 
                    developed an EV Charging Station Route Optimization application using 
                    Python. By implementing Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, we calculated the shortest 
                    path to charging stations, helping EV users navigate efficiently. The 
                    project involved collecting data in a CSV format, creating a graph of 
                    nodes and connections, and utilizing Python libraries like NetworkX and 
                    Matplotlib for visualization. This project demonstrated how algorithms 
                    can optimize real-world navigation challenges, enhancing EV charging 
                    infrastructure.</p>
